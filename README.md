This website was built using React for the frontend, Javascript and mongodb for the backend.

The best in-person trivia game out there! Ever want something to do with your friends when you're bored? Or maybe for adults, a game to play to lighten the mood? Well look no further. This is a trivia game that was built for in-peron playing! Here you can test your knowledge and compete against your firends! We were insipred to create this app because we felt that there were too many times where you are with your friends and have nothing to do. Thus, we were inspired to create a trivia game that was more tailored towards the competitive side of playing.

Once you are done with that, you can now see that there is an option in the top right that says "profile" indicating that you have successfully created an account. Now you can play any trivia game to your liking, ect. unique catagories and difficulties. Once that is done you can see in your profile page that there is your recent game that you played.
